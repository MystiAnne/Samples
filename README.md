# Samples

Some of the content I've written from scratch. Some of them have been modified by other writers after my departure, but remain substantially the same:

* https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/usage/

* https://docs.mulesoft.com/composer-salesforce/ms_composer_overview

* https://developer.okta.com/docs/release-notes/2023/

  Note: Although the release notes that I wrote have been removed, the structure I designed is still in use.

* https://www.postman.com/okta-eng/okta-public-api-collections/folder/dbd5snu/linked-objects?tab=overview

  Note: I edited the Overview content, and managed the collection when it was much smaller.
