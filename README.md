# Samples

Some of the content I've written from scratch. Some of them have been modified by other writers after my departure, but remain substantially the same:

* https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/platform-guide/usage/

* https://docs.mulesoft.com/composer-salesforce/ms_composer_overview

* https://developer.okta.com/docs/release-notes/2023/

  Note: Although the release notes that I wrote have been removed, the structure I designed is still in use.

* https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/rest/

* https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.200.0.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_concepts.htm

Because CrowdStrike documentation is hidden behind a login, I can't share those samples.
